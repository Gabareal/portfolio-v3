                            Hi! My name is Gabriel!<br>
                            I like to code stuff and make cool projects in general. Apart of doing CTFs and homelabbing, I like to cook and play games.<br>
                            I'm not really a front-end developer, so apologies if you experience any bugs in my site. The design is larely inspired by early internet sites and some modern spinoffs on them, such as <a href="https://miserabledolly.net/home">miserabledolly.net</a>

                                This was a team project done in Sec 3 with 3 of my friends. 
                                The task was to design a digital solution to solve a real-world problem, so our idea was to come up with an accessible lost-and-found app! 
                                Although it was never implemented to an actual solution, it taught me a lot about javascript and firebase! 
                                It was one of my first times using an API and interacting with data storage, login systems with cookies, etc. 
                                <br>As you can see, the UI is very "minimalist" at best. Some buttons may not work any more as the firebase token has expired, but feel free to look through the code! (if you want to)

                                My class had a service learning / volunteering session with Willing Hearts, a soup kitchen.
                                Not sure exactly why, but I made this site to showcase our efforts!
                                It's a different style and aesthetic compared to this site, so you can sort of see me grow and jump between styles from modern to minimalism or retro.

                                I was inspired by how Iron Man uses his hands in the air to select stuff on his holographic table, so this site is an attempt of recreating that same effect, but at its very barebones.
                                Although it is one of my cooler mini-projects, a lot of code was made with the help of generative AI, with the UI being entirely AI generated. So take that as you will.
